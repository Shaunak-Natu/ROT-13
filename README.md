# ROT-13 Encoder/Decoder

## What is ROT13?

This is a simple Python program that can be used to encode and decode text using the ROT-13 cipher. ROT-13 is a basic substitution 
cipher that replaces each letter in a message with the letter 13 positions ahead of it in the alphabet. For example, "A" becomes "N",
"B" becomes "O", and so on.

## Usage
To use this program, simply run the rot13.py script from the command line. You will be prompted to enter either "encode" or "decode", 
depending on whether you want to encode or decode your message. Then, you will be prompted to enter the text that you want to encode or decode.
Here is an example: -

</div>

##  Disclaimer
Please note that ROT-13 is a very weak form of encryption that provides little to no security. This program is meant for educational
purposes only and should not be used to encrypt sensitive information.
